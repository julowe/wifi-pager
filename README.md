# Creating a Wifi Pager with an Adafruit MagTag

This project was started because push notifications on iOS were proving unreliable in delivery when at sea. 
So I wanted more control over the software and hardware and actually receive timely warning notifications.

## BOM
[Adafruit MagTag](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4800) often sold at Adafruit, because resellers buy in bulk. So search online.
[Compact USB-C Qi Receiver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVXW3MV/) Hack down the case around the Qi loop & PCB so if can fit in the case
