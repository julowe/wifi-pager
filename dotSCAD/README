# Partial Repo of dotSCAD

This is a (very) partial repo of [Justin Lin's dotSCAD project](https://github.com/JustinSDK/dotSCAD). I have the full repo in my OpenSCAD systen library path, but putting these files here so I can make this file on random computers (e.g. a makerspace after doing test prints).
